CanvasPop Photo Printing API is a simple and powerful way to offer customers the ability to purchase world class
handcrafted canvas prints.

== Description ==

Pop-up Store is a simple and powerful way to offer customers the ability to purchase world class handcrafted canvas
prints that are shipped right to their door. Inside you'll find implementation guides and reference documentation for
all of the components that make up Pop-up Store.

This plugin allows you to automatically add a "Print" button to your images. Users can then click the "Print" button
to open a cart in a modal and purchase a piece of art.

When a user opens a cart, the image provided in the link is submitted to protected environment where it is resized and 
prepared for print. Once a user places an order, you can access information about that order in your API admin panel.

= Do you support mobile? =

Absolutely. Our API works across web, touch and mobile.

= Do you support viewing Pop-up Store in other languages and currencies? =

Yes. Once the store is opened, we geolocate each user using their IP address. From there we select the appropriate currency and language that is appropriate for that region.

We currently support the following languages: Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish.

We currently support the following currencies: US Dollar (USD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), and Pound (GBP).

= If a customer buys prints multiple times, will they have to re-enter their billing and shipping information each time? =

Yes.

= How do I make money? =

We give you a wholesale price for each item purchased. We then add on a markup of your choice. The markup is your commission on the sale of this item.

= How much can I make? =

If you want to see exactly how much you make on each item purchased, you can visit the Products page in your CanvasPop API Administration Panel.

= What is the default markup? =

We default our partners to a 30% markup. You are free to choose your markup rate, just send us an email at API Sales and we can change that for you.

= How can I detect when a customer has completed a purchase or closed the store? =

As a customer interacts with Pop-up Store, these events (and many others) are emitted via HTML 5 pushMessage() calls. You may detect and handle these events however you wish in your application. See the Events documentation page for a list of events and their descriptions. We've also included some code samples on our Examples documentation page to help you get started.

= What image file formats are accepted for use in Pop-up Store? =

We currently accept the following image file types: jpeg, jpg, tif, tiff, png, ico, wmf, emf, bmp, and gif.

= What is the max file size that I may send to the API? =

100MB.

= Are there any notifications sent to customers regarding their order? =

Yes. Currently a receipt and shipping notification are sent to Pop-up Store customers. You can see examples of what these emails look like on the Examples documentation page.

= Is there a way I can place a test order end-to-end when integrating Pop-up Store? =

Yes. By default your store is in TESTING mode. You may create test orders and use testing credit card numbers in order to complete orders. To activate your Pop-up Store in production click on the 'Request Activation' button in your settings.

= Why does a two step preview and print image handshake exist? =

We've developed the API to support first sending us a smaller, lower resolution preview image that allows the initial handshake to be completed quickly. This allows customers to begin interacting with checkout sooner. Once this is completed and the store is opened you may begin uploading a printable, high resolution image in the background. This prevents the customer from experiencing any initial delay and gives them the option to choose sizes, fill out shipping information etc. immediately.

= When using the Pull API, does the image have to reside on my own server or domain? =

No. You may load an image located at any publicly accessible URL into Pop-up Store, however you must own the rights to the image.

= How are the sizes that appear in the cart drop-down menu determined? =

As soon as we know the width, height and resolution of the printable image that is being purchased (either through our /loader or Pull API endpoints) we are able to compute a set of sizes that allow for the best fit with a minimal amount of cropping. This is unique per image, and allows customers to only see sizes that make sense for the image they are purchasing.

= Do I need the rights to sell the images that are uploaded? =

Yes. We can only print the item if you have the necessary rights to sell the image. All copyright images will be refused and refund will be sent to purchaser.
